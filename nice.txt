What do  I need to implement ? 
 get_next_line

 What does get_next_line do ?
    -Attempts to read from a file.
    -If succesfull reads until /n is found
    -Returns the line found

Exceptions :
    -If failed to read from a file returns null
    -If read error returns null
    



Plan:

 1 -> Open file specified by fd. ( read will attempt to open and read from a file if existing)
 2 -> 2 ways to do it. read until /n or read the whole file in 1 go.
 3 -> Parse the data read.
 4 -> Save and return data read.
 5 -> Look for remaining data read (because we read in chunks)
 6 -> Save remaining data .
 7 -> Repeat from step 1

 Start with basic frame of function get_next_line()
